# Universal-cokriging-to-estimate-the-geometry-of-soil-layers
This project consists of a didactic implementation of the "potential field method" (Lajaunie, 1996). The method estimates the geometry of soil layers via universal cokriging of the orientation and contact points between soil layers.  This (pure) python implementation is meant to illustrate the assemblage of the covariance matrices and vectors in the cokriging system. 

This implementation is appended to the journal paper:
